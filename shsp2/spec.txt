SHSP2

This is the DNCP profile of SHSP2, an experimental home automation
protocol.

   o New TLV: type 768, URL. It is variable length string contain URL that can be used to reach the node (usually http:// prefixed but it could be also e.g. https). The /shsp2 endpoint is used with POST requests to send binary DNCP TLV sequences, as well as receive them in the body (if any response is produced). The unicast should use only IPv4 addresses.

   o Multicast transport: IPv6 UDP on port 53923 to link-local scoped multicast address ff02::1:0:42. Each multicast should contain new TLV 768, which contains HTTP URL to send requests to.

   o Unicast transport: IPv4 address only HTTP request to the URL identified in UDP multicast payloads.

   o Security: None. (upper layers care about security)

   o Additional TLVs to be ignored: None.  No DNCP security is specified, and no new TLVs are defined outside of node data.

   o  Node identifier length (DNCP_NODE_IDENTIFIER_LENGTH): 32 bits that are randomly generated.

   o  Node identifier collision handling: Pick new random node identifier.

   o  Trickle parameters: Imin = 200 ms, Imax = 7, k = 1.  It means at least one multicast per link in 25 seconds in stable state (0.2 * 2^7).

   o Hash function H(x) + length: SHA-256.

   o As HTTP does not have persistent connections, keep-alives should be used, but with the dense optimization; if there are more than 2 nodes on the link, dense mode should be used (Section 6.1).

   o  No support for dense multicast-enabled link optimization (Section 6.2)
