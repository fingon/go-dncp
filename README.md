# DNCP (Distributed Node Consensus Protocol) #

This is Go implementation of DNCP ( RFC7787 ).

Not yet particularly serious, combination of vibe coding and some
manual work. I plan to use this for something later on though.

## Design or lack of it

This is mostly generated by LLMs; dncp*.go is public interface in main
package, and the rest contain internal details.
